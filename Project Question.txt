Question Given: 12
	The traditional UNIX scheduler enforces an inverse relationship between priority numbers and priorities: the higher the number, the lower the priority. The scheduler recalculates process priorities once per second using the following function:
	Priority=(recent CPU usage/2)+base
	where base=60 and recent CPU usage refer to value indicating how often a process has used the CPU
	refers to a value indicating how often a process has used the CPU since priorities were last calculated
